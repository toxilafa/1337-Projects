go to http://IP/robots.txt
Then go to : http://IP/whatever/ 

in the file  
root:8621ffdbc5698829397d97767ac13db3

md5_decrypt('8621ffdbc5698829397d97767ac13db3') ===> dragon

we decode the password with the md5 hash and we get 'dragon'

we used the credentions to login in http://{IP}/admin, we got the flag
