On the page http://IP/index.php?page=recover

in the submit form there is the webmaster email here

<input type="hidden" name="mail" value="webmaster@borntosec.com" maxlength="15">


Hidden fields use:
try to submit and you will have error
inspect the code elements, change the email value replay and validation continue to the the value email that you put in the input
for example if you are sending a recover link for password it will send to any email that you put in the value in this way !

solution:
Data sent to the user must be validated on the server once the user click submit before send to the recover to the email
