How Brute-Force Attacks Work
Brute-force attacks take advantage of automation to try many more passwords than a human could, breaking into a system through trial and error.
More targeted brute-force attacks use a list of common passwords to speed this up, called dictionary attacks,
and using this technique to check for weak passwords is often the first attack a hacker will try against a system.
